RiftDotNet
==========

This project is a simple .NET wrapper around the Oculus Rift SDK. The structure is virtually identical to the one of the SDK, and thus the c++ samples
can easily be substituted for .NET, for example C#, code.

In order to use this project, a reference to RiftDotNet is required. The assembly itself is built for AnyCPU and has been tested on
both x86 and x64 platforms.

External dependencies are SharpDX (for mathematical structures like quaternion or vectors) and Log4Net.
